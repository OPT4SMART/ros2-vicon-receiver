# Vicon receiver for ROS 2 ![GitHub tag (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/andreacamisa/ros2-vicon-receiver)

Fork of https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ros2-vicon-receiver, fixed the following, which occurred when running this package on ROS2 Humble with Ubuntu 22.04 
 
```

**ros2-vicon-receiver** is a ROS 2 package, written in C++, that retrieves data from Vicon software and publishes it on ROS 2 topics. The code is partly derived from a mixture of [Vicon-ROS2](https://github.com/aheuillet/Vicon-ROS2) and [Vicon bridge](https://github.com/ethz-asl/vicon_bridge).

This is NOT an official ROS 2 package and is not supported. The package has been successfully tested with ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04. 

## Requirements

### Installation of dependencies
Make sure you have ROS 2 installed (follow the instructions at the [ROS 2 website](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/)).

Then, install [Colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/index.html) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) :
```
$ sudo apt install -y python3-colcon-common-extensions cmake
```

### Installation of Datastream SDK and other libraries

The Datastream SDK libraries are required to be installed in the system. You can find them on [the official website](https://www.vicon.com/software/datastream-sdk/?section=downloads).

This package is shipped with Datastream SDK 10.1 (the latest version at the time of writing). If you are running Linux x64 and you want to install this version, simply `cd` into the main project folder and issue the command
```
$ ./install_libs.sh
```

## Quick start

### Building the package

:warning: Do not forget to source the ROS 2 workspace: `source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash`

Enter the project folder and build the executable
```
$ cd vicon_receiver
$ colcon build --symlink-install
```

### Running the program

Open a new terminal and source the project workspace:
```
$ source vicon_receiver/install/setup.bash
```

To run the program, use the [launch file template](vicon_receiver/launch/client.launch.py) provided in the package. First, open the file and edit the parameters. Running `colcon build` is not needed because of the `--symlink-install` option previously used.

Now you can the program with
```
$ ros2 launch vicon_receiver client.launch.py
```

Exit the program with CTRL+C.

### Information on ROS 2 topics and messages

The **ros2-vicon-receiver** package creates a topic for each segment in each subject with the pattern `namespace/subject_name/segment_name`. Information is published on the topics as soon as new data is available from the vicon client (typically at the vicon client frequency). The message type [Position](vicon_receiver/msg/Position.msg) is used.

Example: suppose your namespace is the default `vicon` and you have two subjects (`subject_1` and `subject_2`) with two segments each (`segment_1` and `segment_2`). Then **ros2-vicon-receiver** will publish [Position](vicon_receiver/msg/Position.msg) messages on the following topics:
```
vicon/subject_1/segment_1
vicon/subject_1/segment_2
vicon/subject_2/segment_1
vicon/subject_2/segment_2
```
